This repository contains code examples of [JUnit 5] for the book [Mastering Software Testing with JUnit 5], authored by [Boni Garcia] and published by [Packt]. These examples covers the main features of JUnit 5, such as:

* JUnit 5 tests lifecycle.
* Assertions.
* Tagging and filtering tests.
* Conditional test execution.
* Nested and repeated tests.
* Migration from JUnit 4.
* Dependency injection.
* Dynamic tests.
* Test interfaces.
* Test templates.
* Parameterized tests.
* Parallel execution.
* Ordered tests.

Moreover, the integration with third-party frameworks and technologies is also illustrated with examples, concretely:

* Mockito (popular mock framework).
* Spring (Java framework aimed to created enterprise applications based on dependency injection).
* Docker (container platform technology).
* Selenium (test framework for web applications).
* Appium (driver for mobile devices).
* Android (open source mobile operating system based on Linux).
* REST services (using REST Assured, Retrofit2, or WireMock).
